# 🕵️ Crime Prediction

To develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of crime occurrence in specific regions using historical crime rate data.

## 🔍 Overview

This project builds and evaluates a predictive model using structured public data to estimate regional crime risk. By integrating and preprocessing datasets such as crime rates, population, and police station locations, we train several machine learning models and visualize key patterns in the data.

🗓️ Project Period: March 31, 2025 – April 10, 2025

📊 Data Sources:  
- 지역별 범죄율 통계.xlsx  
- 지역별 인구수.xlsx  
- 지역 내 경찰서.xlsx
- ...
